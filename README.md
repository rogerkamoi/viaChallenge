# viaChallenge
Via challenge assignment

This is the service repo. The serialized model from the viaChallengeModel repo was uploaded and run.

Flask was used to produce the service. 

- Attempt to upload to Azure failed due to debug mode option - turn it to false did not work
- the service in Flask had different behaviors and in the last refactor stoped working.........
